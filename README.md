## Forward and Backward Propagation
Forward propagation involves passing input data through the network to generate predictions, while backward propagation computes gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters, enabling optimization via gradient descent.

## Optimizer
The optimizer updates the network parameters based on the computed gradients during backward propagation. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

## Activation Function
Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex mappings between input and output. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.

## Early Stopping
Early stopping is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by halting training when performance on a validation dataset starts to degrade, thus avoiding unnecessary epochs.

## Model Training
Model training involves iteratively feeding batches of data through the network, computing predictions, calculating the loss, performing backward propagation to update parameters, and repeating until convergence criteria are met.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and neurons per layer to optimize the performance of the neural network on a validation dataset.
